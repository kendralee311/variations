        <h1>Dyed Carnations</h1>
        
        <h2>By Robin Schiff</h2>

        <div class="main">
        <p>There's <em>blue</em>, and <em>then there's blue</em>.<br>

        A number, not a hue, this is blue<br>

        is not the undertone of any one<br>

        but there it is, <em>primary</em><br>

        I held the bouquet<br>

        in shock and cut the stems at a <em>deadly</em> angle.<br>

        I opened the toxic sachet of flower food<br>

        with my <em>canine</em> and rinsed my mouth.<br>

        I used to wash my hands and daydream.<br>

        I dreamed of myself and washed<br>

        my hands of everything. <em>Easy math</em>.<br>

        Now I can't get their procedure<br>

        at the florist off my mind.<br>
            
        the white flowers <em>arrived!</em> They overnighted<br>
            
        in a chemical bath<br>
            
        and now they have a fake laugh<br>
            
        that catches like a match<br>
            
        that starts the kind of kitchen <em>fire</em><br>
            
        that is fanned by water.<br>
            
        They won't even look at me.<br>
            
        <em>Happy Anniversary.</em></p>
    </div>
