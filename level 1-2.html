        &nbsp;<p>Dyed Carnations</p>

        <p>By Robin Schiff</p>

        &nbsp;<p>There's blue, and then there's blue.<br>

        A number, not a hue, this is blue<br>

        is not the undertone of any one<br>

        but there it is, primary</p>

        &nbsp;<p>I held the bouquet<br>

        in shock and cut the stems at a deadly angle.<br>

        I opened the toxic sachet of flower food<br>

        with my canine and rinsed my mouth.</p>

        &nbsp;<p>I used to wash my hands and daydream.<br>

        I dreamed of myself and washed<br>

        my hands of everything. Easy math.</p>

        &nbsp;<p>Now I can't get their procedure<br>

        at the florist off my mind.<br>
            
        the white flowers arrived! They overnighted<br>
            
        in a chemical bath</p>
            
        &nbsp;<p>and now they have a fake laugh<br>
            
        that catches like a match<br>
            
        that starts the kind of kitchen fire<br>
            
        that is fanned by water.</p>
            
        &nbsp;<p>They won't even look at me.<br>
            
        Happy Anniversary.</p>
