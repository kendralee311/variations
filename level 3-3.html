        <h1>Dyed Carnations</h1>

        <h2>By Robin Schiff</h2>

        <div class="main">
        <p>There's blue, and then there's blue.<br>

        A number, not a hue, this is blue<br>

        is not the undertone of any one<br>

        but there it is, primary<br>

        I held the bouquet<br>

        in shock and <strong>cut the stems at a deadly angle.</strong><br>

        I opened <strong>the toxic sachet of flower food</strong><br>

        with my canine <strong>and rinsed my mouth.</strong><br>

        I used to <strong>wash my hands and daydream.</strong><br>

        I dreamed of myself and washed<br>

        my hands of everything. Easy math.<br>

        Now I can't get their procedure<br>

        at the florist off my mind.<br>
            
        the white flowers arrived! They overnighted<br>
            
        in a chemical bath<br>
            
        and now they have a fake laugh<br>
            
        that catches like a match<br>
            
        that starts the kind of kitchen fire<br>
            
        that is fanned by water.</p>
            
        <div class="float">
        They won't even look at me.<br>
        Happy Anniversary.
        </div>
